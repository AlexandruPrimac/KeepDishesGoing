# KeepDishesGoing
Keep Dishes Going is a student project I worked on to explore how a food ordering platform could handle real-world challenges like menu accuracy, order flow, and clear communication between restaurants, customers, and delivery.

The idea behind the project is to build a small marketplace where restaurants control what they offer, customers can place orders with confidence, and order status stays transparent from checkout to handoff. My focus was on keeping what users see in sync with what restaurants intend to sell, making timely decisions about incoming orders, and clearly signaling when food is ready.

This project was designed as a practical learning experience, helping me apply my development skills to a realistic scenario involving state management, reliability, and user experience in a fast-paced ordering environment.
